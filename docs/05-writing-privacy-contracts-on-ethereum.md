# Writing privacy contracts on Ethereum

This guide defines the EVM-side design model for PoD contracts.

## 1. Classify each value before writing code

For each input, output, and state field, classify as:

- public metadata (`address`, `uint`, `bytes32`, enums),
- private user input (`it*`),
- private user-readable output (`ct*`),
- COTI compute-domain value (`gt*`, COTI side only).

Reference: `/docs/contracts/01-it-ct-gt-data-types.md`.

## 2. Pick integration mode

## Library mode

Use `MpcLib` when your operation is covered:

- `add`
- `gt`

You implement EVM request/callback logic only.

## Custom mode

Use `MpcAbiCodec` + a COTI-side contract when operation is not covered by `MpcLib`.

You must define and maintain:

- request selector + argument order,
- COTI function signature,
- callback tuple schema.

## 3. Convert synchronous logic into async state machine

Private operations are async:

1. Submit request.
2. Store correlation state by `requestId`.
3. Handle callback.
4. Handle failures.

Recommended storage primitives:

- `mapping(bytes32 => RequestStatus)`
- `mapping(bytes32 => ResultType)`
- business-key to request mapping.

## 4. Enforce callback boundary

- Use `onlyInbox` on callback and error handlers.
- Decode callback bytes with exact tuple shape.
- Reject or safely handle unknown request IDs.

## 5. Secure configuration paths

Important: `MpcUser.configureCoti(...)` is `public virtual` in this SDK.

Production guidance:

- wrap or override with access control,
- emit config change events,
- consider timelock/multisig for privileged changes.

## 6. Design UX-safe read APIs

Expose async-friendly APIs:

- request submission event with indexed `requestId`,
- status reader (`pending/completed/failed`),
- ciphertext result reader (`ct*`) for client decryption.

Do not design private operations around immediate return values.

## 7. Keep ABI stable

For request and callback payloads:

- keep argument order deterministic,
- version schemas when changing tuple layouts,
- update EVM decode and COTI encode together.

## 8. Testing requirements

Minimum test set:

- callback success path updates expected state,
- callback call from non-Inbox reverts,
- error path emits useful diagnostics,
- request mapping points to correct domain entity,
- decryptability of resulting `ct*` values in integration flow.

## 9. Deployment readiness

- Inbox address set correctly per network.
- COTI executor and chain ID configured.
- config functions access-controlled.
- events cover request creation, completion, and failure.
